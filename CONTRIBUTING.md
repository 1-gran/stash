## Semantic Versioning 2.0
Ideally we should never reach a 2.0 with this unless we add a new API 

## Stable only commits
This is possible through Squashing and Rebasing your commits.

## Master vs Production
Master being the default branch for ease of access and to follow the suggested GitLab workflow will remain the "Development" branch.

Production being the branch where all things fully tested, stable, with proper versions will be Squashed and Merged into Production branch via Pull Request.
